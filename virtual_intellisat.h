/**@file virtual_intellisat.h
 *
 * @brief ADCS Software's interface to Intellisat.
 *
 * This file contains the function prototype for every
 *  actuator-commanding and sensor-reading function
 *  the ADCS Software needs from Intellisat.
 *
 * Their corresponding definitions will be written in the Intellisat
 *  repo by the CS team. While this means any ADCS code that uses
 *  these functions cannot run outside of the Intellisat repo, 
 *  this approach allows for complete separation of the two repos,
 *  which vastly simplifies development for everyone. And, while
 *  such code will not run, it will still compile!
